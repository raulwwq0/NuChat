# Frontend with Nuxt 3

[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a meta-framework built on top of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

## Why I use Nuxt?

I already had a vast knowledge about the Vue ecosystem, so I want to try new things. Nuxt provide developers a lot of features out of the box such as Server Side Rendering, SEO helpers, auto-imports...
