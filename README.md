# NuChat

NuChat is an instant messaging app (similar to WhatsApp) built with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Installation

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo), so to install all dependencies from every part of the project you just need to run the following command:

```bash
npm install # or "npm i"
```

After that, you just need to run the next command to start the whole app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **Note**: Since Turborepo works with _npm monorepos_, running the previous commands in the project root will execute the exact same command in each folders inside `apps` directory (sub-project). You can also run the command you want inside each sub-project to avoid executing them globally.
